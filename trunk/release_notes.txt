USB fixes:
- support for sticks that do not reliably reply to the 'inquiry' command
- Byte alignment issue fixed when writing. This caused corrupted G64s to be written sometimes
- Support for composite devices added
- Added support for USB keyboards, to navigate the Ultimate browser menu

Incorporated patches from Markus & Henning, including, but not limited to:
- Audio squeal fix, speaker volume addition
- Ultimate DOS V1.1 with added commands
- Added Home Directory support
- Added support for GeoRAM

IEC fixes
- IEC now operates properly on the bus, when it is alone (disabled 1541 drives)
- IEC filename fixes; saving a file to IEC adds the right extension and also removes the extension when loading directory
- IEC should now work with JiffyDOS  (not yet supporting the JiffyDOS protocol)
- UltiCopy is working again!

Other small fixes
- Small fix in TCP support (TCP hangup on retransmission)
- Save disk twice bug fixed
- Fixed load errors on tape adapter cable with some USB 3.0 cables
- Keyboard "racekeys" fixed
- Reduced Link Up time for the Ethernet port
- Ultimax mode ROMs now allow video data in ROM

3.0 BETA 7
==========
Processor flag error fixed.
Some 6502 opcode testing done. Fixed ADC in decimal mode.

Some fixes:
ISSUE 189: Mount disk is now performed when C64/drive is not frozen
ISSUE 191: Loading a file from within T64 (and D64) could fail at times due to special chars. Fixed
ISSUE 193: Tape grab to TAP file fixed (at least that the option to run it will work)
ISSUE 204: TCP slowdown fixed; bug in USB driver
ISSUE 207: Typo fixed that caused "Save to disk" to fail with a 0 byte file
OTHER: SID file with faulty header now no longer causes Flash corruption
OTHER: Tape play / record functions updated

Major:
* BUGFIX: Processor's Data Cache stored result of IO read, causing wrong values to be read from the cache

Minor:
* C64 Keyboard scan made a bit slower  (not tested)
* Fixed configuration drop down
* Fixed clock settings
* Mount disk made first option in D64 file type
* Updated Final 3 cart.

* AT49 flash support removed (kills address 0)
* LwipOpts reviewed (has this been validated?)
* Added 300 us delay in startup code to allow SDRAM to initialize (didn't fix anything)
* Restart TCP socket now supports loading the updater (variable start address)



3.0 BETA 4 (first version released on Facebook)
===============================================

The FPGA platform has gotten an upgrade. There is now a faster RISC processor
on board (~10 times faster), and I have re-written the USB host controller,
which has become ~50 times faster. The external memory of the FPGA also runs
faster, and delivers now also approx. 7 times more bandwidth. With this faster
platform, it has become possible to run a multithreaded OS.

There is now support for USB2LAN adapters, and 3.0beta4 runs two services: a
(raw-)telnet (VT100) server that brings up the menu, and an FTP daemon for
basic file transfer.

There is now support for reading the directories of D71 and D81 files in the
browser.

There is a 'CD' command in the software IEC, and other improvements have been
made to the soft IEC driver.

There is now a copy command in the file browser, that works with C=C/C=V
(or CTRL-C / CTRL-V). It is not that fast, but for small files it works. You
can also copy files from inside a D64/T64 to another location in the file
system. The other way around is still under development, but will soon be
possible as well.

UltiCopy is disabled for now, because it still needs to be ported to the
multi-threaded operating system.
