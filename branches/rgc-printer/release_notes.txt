Major:
* BUGFIX: Processor's Data Cache stored result of IO read, causing wrong values to be read from the cache

Minor:
* C64 Keyboard scan made a bit slower  (not tested)
* Fixed configuration drop down
* Fixed clock settings
* Mount disk made first option in D64 file type
* Updated Final 3 cart.

* AT49 flash support removed (kills address 0)
* LwipOpts reviewed (has this been validated?)
* Added 300 us delay in startup code to allow SDRAM to initialize (didn't fix anything)
* Restart TCP socket now supports loading the updater (variable start address)



3.0 BETA 4 (first version released on Facebook)
===============================================

The FPGA platform has gotten an upgrade. There is now a faster RISC processor
on board (~10 times faster), and I have re-written the USB host controller,
which has become ~50 times faster. The external memory of the FPGA also runs
faster, and delivers now also approx. 7 times more bandwidth. With this faster
platform, it has become possible to run a multithreaded OS.

There is now support for USB2LAN adapters, and 3.0beta4 runs two services: a
(raw-)telnet (VT100) server that brings up the menu, and an FTP daemon for
basic file transfer.

There is now support for reading the directories of D71 and D81 files in the
browser.

There is a 'CD' command in the software IEC, and other improvements have been
made to the soft IEC driver.

There is now a copy command in the file browser, that works with C=C/C=V
(or CTRL-C / CTRL-V). It is not that fast, but for small files it works. You
can also copy files from inside a D64/T64 to another location in the file
system. The other way around is still under development, but will soon be
possible as well.

UltiCopy is disabled for now, because it still needs to be ported to the
multi-threaded operating system.
